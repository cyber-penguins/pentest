Important Things to Remember
-----------------------------|
From https://medium.com/@PenTest_duck/offensive-msfvenom-from-generating-shellcode-to-creating-trojans-4be10179bb86
One thing to note here is the difference between staged and stageless payloads.
Staged payloads are denoted with the use of a forward slash (/; e.g. windows/shell/reverse_tcp). Staged payloads send a small stager to the target, which connects back to the attacker and downloads the rest of the payload. Therefore, staged payloads need special payload listeners, such as multi/handler in Metasploit. Staged payloads are ideal in situations where you have limited shellcode space, most commonly in Buffer Overflows (but that’s a story for another day).
Stageless payloads are denoted with the use of an underscore (_; e.g. windows/shell_reverse_tcp). Stageless payloads send the entire payload to the target at once, and therefore don’t require the attacker to provide more data. That means we have a variety of listeners we can use, such as Netcat. Find out how to set up a listener using Netcat/Ncat in my post here.
